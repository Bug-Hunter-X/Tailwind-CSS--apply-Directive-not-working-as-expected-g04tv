// Correct the Tailwind CSS configuration to include the required plugins or correct the build process to ensure that `@apply` directives are properly processed.  In some cases, a conflict with another css rule may be present.

//If the issue still persists, provide more context including your project configuration, Tailwind config file, and the full relevant CSS code.
