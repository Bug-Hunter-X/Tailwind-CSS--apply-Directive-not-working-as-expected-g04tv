# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS. The `@apply` directive is expected to apply the specified styles to the element, but in this case, it is not working as expected.

## Description
The `@apply` directive is supposed to apply the styles associated with a particular utility class to the element. This is typically used to create reusable style sets.

In this case, the `@apply` directive doesn't apply the styles correctly. This issue occurs despite proper configuration of Tailwind CSS and the use of valid utility classes.

## Reproduction
To reproduce the issue, simply run the provided Javascript code.  The expected output is that the div element has text centered.  Instead, the text will not be centered.

## Solution
The solution involves checking if Tailwind CSS is properly configured and whether the build process is correctly processing the `@apply` directives.  Common issues include:
* Incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration files (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`)
* Problems with the CSS build process (e.g., missing or incorrect plugins)
* Conflicting CSS styles
* Missing or incorrect purge configuration (if using PurgeCSS)
